# RL-AV

This repository contains code for a reinforcement learning (RL) agent in a Gymnasium environment designed for autonomous vehicle (AV) simulations.

## Project Overview

The RL-AV project aims to train and evaluate reinforcement learning agents using the Gymnasium environment for autonomous driving tasks. The project leverages various RL algorithms to explore the challenges of self-driving scenarios.

## Features

- Custom Gymnasium environment for car racing simulations.
- Integration with popular RL libraries such as Stable-Baselines3.
- Visualization and evaluation scripts for analyzing agent performance.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kiazandifar/RL-AV.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd RL-AV
3. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
4.Install the dependencies using the requirements.txt file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
